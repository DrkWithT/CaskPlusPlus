# README

### Brief:
Cask will be an imperative, bytecode-targeting language with C-like constructs with a modern syntax based on Python and Typescript.

Also, I realized that writing another toy language interpreter in C was too tedious in string handling, memory management, etc. Thus, I decided to rewrite "Cask" in C++. 

### TODO:
 1. Implement Token and Lexer. (WIP)
 2. Implement AST.
 3. Implement Parser.
 4. Implement Compiler (naive one that uses the AST as the IR for code generation).
 5. Implement stack-based VM.
